  "Kaizen (net-babiniku co-scientist round 67): regression coverage for a real bug found in
   `kami.webgl/upload-mesh!` (src/kami/webgl.cljc) -- the vertex-interleaving expression itself
   is pure data transformation (no browser API), so it's directly testable here on the JVM even
   though the surrounding namespace is `#?(:cljs ...)`-gated and can't be required directly.

   `(mapcat concat (map vector positions normals))` does NOT flatten to raw floats: `map vector`
   first pairs each position/normal triple into a single 2-element vector, then `mapcat concat`
   over that ONE-collection seq calls `concat` with a single argument per element, which just
   returns the pair's own two elements unflattened -- the inner 3-element triples are never
   broken down to individual numbers. `js/Float32Array.`'s constructor coerces each of those
   nested 3-element arrays via `Number([...])`, which is NaN for anything but a 1-element array
   -- so EVERY vertex uploaded via this path has silently been all-NaN since this function was
   written, and the WebGL2 fallback's entire 3D mesh path (net-babiniku's placeholder box,
   round 66/US-129) rendered nothing. Fixed: drop the `map vector` step and use mapcat's own
   multi-collection form directly -- `(mapcat concat positions normals)` maps `concat` over
   PARALLEL elements from both collections, and `concat` with two arguments genuinely
   concatenates them into one flat 6-element seq per vertex."
